    <h1>Is cricket is a game or a sport?</h1>

    <p>
      Let's look at the evidence. 22 'players'. 9 of which will always be
      indoors with their feet up during play. Another 10 of which will be
      standing stationary in the field. Every now and again (perhaps even once a
      minute!!) those 10 players will need to prepare to possibly move and then
      more than likely won't need to. They may as well be asleep, as a good
      proportion of the crowd will be at any given time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Most balls delivered (again, perhaps reaching the heady rate of one every
      sixty seconds on a good day and when the bowling team aren't deliberately
      slowing play) will either result in no stroke attempted by the batsman or
      will be blocked and drop at the batsman's feet.
      <br />
      <br />
      This can go on for as long as FIVE DAYS with a reasonable chance of
      producing NO RESULT. Some people find this entertaining - and good luck to
      them- but if this is a sport then we need to revisit the definition of
      'sport'.

    <h3>Another Opinion of Sae sort</h3>
    <p>
      tThe basic difference between a game and a sport is thatâ€¦ A game portrays
      the collective efforts of individuals whereas a sport pertains to an
      individuals abilities and his performance.. cricket is a mixed form as we
      can see different people performing different works and collectively
      making it a game.
      <br />
      <br />
      so we can conclude that cricketers are sportsman but cricket is a 'game'
